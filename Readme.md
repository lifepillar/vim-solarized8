# Solarized 8: True Colors

This is yet another Solarized theme for Vim. It places itself half way between
the original [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized)
and the [Flattened](https://github.com/romainl/flattened) variant. It
removes only *some* of the bullshit. The color palette is exactly the same as
in Solarized, of course, although some highlight groups are defined slightly
differently (and better, in my opinion).

The main reason for the existence of this project is that the original Solarized
theme does not define `guifg` and `guibg` in terminal Vim, which means that gui
colors cannot be used with versions of Vim supporting true-color terminals.
Another reason is that I do not understand why a color scheme should dynamically
compute constant values again and again. So, this version may be thought of as
a “compiled” Solarized (in fact, code from the original Solarized is used as
“source” code), and it loads >2.2x times as fast (not that you are likely to
notice the difference…).

This color scheme works **out of the box** if you use:

- Vim ≥7.4.1799 with `termguicolors` set, or
- NeoVim,

**and** a true-color enabled terminal (e.g., [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com)).

Solarized 8 also works in MacVim, gVim, etc…: no configuration is needed.

For terminals not supporting true colors, the requirement is the same as for the
other color schemes: your 16 terminal ASCII colors must be set to the Solarized
palette. The ugly degraded 256-color variant has been removed.


## Installation

If your Vim supports packages (`echo has('packages')` prints `1`), I strongly
recommend that you use them. Just clone this repo inside `pack/*/opt`, e.g.:

    git clone https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8.git \
     ~/.vim/pack/themes/opt/solarized8

Otherwise, use your favourite installation method.

There are actually 8 optimized color schemes:

- `solarized8_dark` and `solarized8_light`: the default Solarized theme;
- `solarized8_dark_low` and `solarized8_light_low`: low-contrast variant;
- `solarized8_dark_high` and `solarized8_light_high`: high-contrast variant;
- `solarized8_dark_flat` and `solarized8_light_flat`: “flat” variant (not
  present in the original Solarized).

To use any of them, put a line like the following in your `.vimrc`:

    colorscheme solarized8_dark

**Note:** if you use Vim packages, there is no need to `packadd solarized8`.
Keep your `runtimepath` clean!


## Options

The following options are inherited from Solarized:

- `g:solarized_visibility`: one of `"normal"` (default), `"low"`, `"high"`;
- `g:solarized_diffmode`: one of `"normal"` (default), `"low"`, `"high"`;
- `g:solarized_termtrans`: make terminal background transparent if set to `1`
  (default: `0`).

The following options were not available in the original Solarized:

- `g:solarized_statusline`: one of `"normal"` (default) or `"low"`;
- `g:solarized_term_italics`: set to `1` if your terminal supports italics
  (default is `0`).

These options may be used with any `solarized8_*` variant.


## Troubleshooting

**Hey, I do not get the right colors when running Vim inside tmux!**

Put this in your `.vimrc`:

```
set t_8f=^[[38;2;%lu;%lu;%lum
set t_8b=^[[48;2;%lu;%lu;%lum
```

where `^[` is *not* obtained by typing `^` followed by `[`, but it is a real
escape character (to obtain it, type `<Ctrl-v><Ctrl-[>` in Insert mode). If that
does not work yet, try replacing the semicolons with colons. See `:h
xterm-true-color` for the details.

## Tips

If you want to quickly toggle between dark and light background, you may define
a mapping like the following:

```
nnoremap  <leader>B :<c-u>exe "colors" (g:colors_name =~# "dark"
    \ ? substitute(g:colors_name, 'dark', 'light', '')
    \ : substitute(g:colors_name, 'light', 'dark', '')
    \ )<cr>
```

To tune the contrast level you may use the following snippet:

```
fun! Solarized8Contrast(delta)
  let l:schemes = map(["_low", "_flat", "", "_high"], '"solarized8_".(&background).v:val')
  exe "colors" l:schemes[((a:delta+index(l:schemes, g:colors_name)) % 4 + 4) % 4]
endf

nmap <leader>- :<c-u>call Solarized8Contrast(-v:count1)<cr>
nmap <leader>+ :<c-u>call Solarized8Contrast(+v:count1)<cr>
```

If you want to tweak the colors yourself, edit `src/solarized8.vim`, then `:source`
it to recreate the color schemes.
