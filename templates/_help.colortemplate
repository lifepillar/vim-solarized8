			@fullname color scheme

Modernized and actively maintained Solarized color scheme for Vim.

==============================================================================
Colorscheme options				*@shortname-options*

						*g:@optionprefix_diffmode*
Tweak the way diffs are displayed. Allowed values are `"normal"` (default),
`"high"`, and `"low"`.
>
	let g:@optionprefix_diffmode = "normal"
<
						*g:@optionprefix_extra_hi_groups*
Set to 0 to disable filetype-specific syntax highlight group.
>
	let g:@optionprefix_extra_hi_groups = 1
<
NOTE: setting this to 0 may avoid "a wake of destruction when switching away"
(T. Pope) in older versions of Vimâ€”that is, when you switch to a different
colorscheme the highlighting may look wrong or disabled.

						*g:@optionprefix_italics*
Set to 0 if you do not want to enable italics.
>
	let g:@optionprefix_italics = 1
<

						*g:@optionprefix_old_cursor_style*
Set to 1 if you want to use the original Solarized's cursor style. By default,
the cursor is blue. NOTE: your terminal may override the cursor's color.
>
	let g:@optionprefix_old_cursor_style = 0
<
						*g:@optionprefix_statusline*
Set to `"low"` to reduce the contrast in the status line. Set to `"flat"` to
make the status lines, tab bars and vertical splits similar to how they look
in the flat variant (of course, `"flat"` does not have any effect in the flat
variant).
>
	let g:@optionprefix_statusline = "normal"
<
						*g:@optionprefix_termtrans*
Set to 1 if you want a transparent background. Takes effect only in the
terminal.
>
	let g:@optionprefix_termtrans = 0
<
						*g:@optionprefix_t_Co*
Set this to tell the colorscheme how many colors are available.

						*g:@optionprefix_visibility*
Tweak the visibility of a few  elements. Allowed values are `"normal"`
(default), `"high"`, and `"low"`.
>
	let g:@optionprefix_visibility = "normal"
<
